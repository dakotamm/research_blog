## Exploring Penn Cove Data Profiles

I've been a bit behind this week due to some illness and generally learning how to take classes again. But for now, here's some quick plots I made for the three Penn Cove transect stations: PENNCOVEWEST, PENNCOVEENT, and SARATOGARP. See previous blog for map locations. I consider CT, SA, and DO for my three seasons: loDO, winter, and grow. These are colored by sampling date - the purple-er, the older.

Starting at the western end of Penn Cove:

Now at the entrance of Penn Cove:

And now out in Saratoga Passage:

I'm again a bit light on written interpretation, but I'm wondering if my seasonal distributions make sense in Penn Cove? Next week I'll dedicate more time to this especially after not feeling sick!
