# Preliminary Whidbey Model vs. Observtions

After some excitement last week at the uses of this model for field work, I've taken a step back to focus on some model evaluation for my 2017 test nested model in Whidbey Basin. Careful evaluation now ensures it will be useful for both science and planning in the future.

First, I've compared the cas7_t0_x4b (long hindcast) model to bottle samples taken at the three routinely monitored Ecology stations in Whidbey Basin.

Then I also compared observtions to wb1_r0_xn11b (my test model):

NOTE: I'll try to get these on the same axes before the meeting, but I'm working with Parker's code instead of reinventing all these scripts.

The Whidbey model is not significantly better matched to observation (which is good) but tends to match DO better. **More experienced modelers:** What stands out here? Is there anything I should be looking at more specifically?
