# Penn Cove Section Animations

I have created an animation from my Whidbey Basin nested model to complement field planning and collection on Thursday, December 4, 2025. The following video has 5 transects in Penn Cove. Each transect is plotting the velocity vectory that crosses the transect most normally. In other words, for the north-south transects, I'm plotting the east-west velocity "u" and vise versa for the east-west transects using "v". Eastward and northward are positive (red) for "u" and "v", respectively.

I have used hourly output for the most similar tides to December 4, 2025: December 3 & 4, 2017. Both days have very similar timing and amplitude of tides. I included both days and some buffer on either end (72 hours in total). Please note the axis limits difference (just a tad) between "u" and "v" - this is using some built in LO stuff that I haven't had a chance to overhaul yet.

Hourly modeled surface velocities, mooring locations, and five transects of approximately normal velocities in Penn Cove for December 3-4, 2017.</p><br>
