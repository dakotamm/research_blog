## Penn Cove Transects

Last week I was unable to show a bunch of meaningful data, but we did see some interesting "mid-depth oxygen minima" that occur in the deeper parts of Penn Cove and out in Saratoga Passage. To investigate this further, I used observational data to create a timelapse of transect contours.

Unfortunately, I spent way too much time trying to get this right. The bathymetry masking was a really annoying issue that I couldn't quite solve before this meeting. I was able to use KDTree (nearest-neighbor) algorithms but was unable to write my own linear interpolation from here. I promise this was supposed to be way prettier, but I think it shows something interesting nonetheless.

Even though this is quite rough, I'm excited for some cool features! The most prominent is that DO lows seem to originate from inside Penn Cove, as observed. Also the "eastward" movement of low DO seems to follow after a significant build-up of low DO water at the entrance. This leads nicely to my next section.

## Whidbey Science Questions

As we work to develop the next part of my PhD work and beyond, here's some brainstorming on Penn Cove/Whidbey science questions:
* What mechanisms drive low DO water spatial and temporal variation in Penn Cove? (Especially given the seeming origin within Penn Cove...)
  * What role do nutrients play? What role do physical processses play (e.g., wind or tides)?
* What influence do Skagit/freshwater events have on Penn Cove and throughout Whidbey Basin?
  * Even though Penn Cove low DO seems to originate from within, stratification from external freshwater likely plays a role.
* Related - what is the salinity structure in Penn Cove throughout the year? How does this differ from other regions in Whidbey Basin?
* What is the exchange flow structure in Puget Sound? Some theory suggests reverse exchange flow - is this supported by data/model?
* What is the role of rain/freshwater lenses on low DO events in Penn Cove? Turbidity?
* Is there variability in oxygen drawdown rates in Penn Cove or other regions in Whidbey Basin, given that there appears to be significantly more internal forcing than external in Penn Cove oxygen?
  * Following on Aurora's work - if low DO water entering Penn Cove doesn't cause hypoxia...what does?
