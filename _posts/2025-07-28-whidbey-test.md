# Whidbey Model Test1 Output

This post is mainly to show that I ran a model! And I can view the basic outputs like temperature and salinity. I ran the model for just 2017.01.01 and did not run a biogeochemistry module.

## Temperature & Salinity Hourly Surface Output

A few quick observations:
* Surface river plumes look fairly realistic.
* Surface currents seems to get a little wacky through Deception Pass - could this be a result of the tight passage here, both physically and in grid space?
* There appear to be some "missing" cells in some timesteps in salinity...

The next step I undertook was to run this for a few more days with a biogeochemical module. I was able to initialize this model but it didn't run past the first day. I'll dig into this further.
