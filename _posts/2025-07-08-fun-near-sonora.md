### Quick Stop on Salt Spring Island

This is work-related since you can see ocean in the background! Specifically - Stuart Channel (between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island) is shown.

### Big Tides Around Sonora Island

We took a quick jaunt to the towering peaks and narrow channels of the Discovery Islands, the southernmost islands before the narrows beginning with the Johnstone Strait turn into the Strait of Georgia. It's also right next door to Desolation Sound.

Finally we settled in at Sonora Island!

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7b2ef0-b758-45c2-b85f-5113bcba3c34" width="800"/><br>Fig 4. View from Sonora Island Resort of Stuart Island and the Gillard Islands, and across the Yaculta Rapids.</p><br>

Lucky for us scientists and all the creatures, it was the New Moon - which means we had huge tides! We took a tour to Bute Inlet, crossing the Arran Rapids during ebb tide. I didn't take any pictures since I didn't want to lose it to a whirlpool and the incessant rain made it a bit slippery out! We were looking for bears taking advantage of the super low tides in Bute Inlet; while we didn't see any, we saw about a billion (give or take) bald eagles that evidently wait at the Arran Rapids for sudden upwelling induced by tidal currents to cause fish swim bladders to rupture and provide buffet-style eagle dinner. Wouldn't want to be a fish!

Here's a picture of the cool science outfit we got to wear!

We then went searching for whales after exploring the calm water in the inlets. We made it to Mitlenatch Island, which comes from First Nation Sliammon language for calm waters all around. I haven't verified this in too much depth, but our guide said that this stems from the fact that this is where the tidal current direction switches. North of Mitlenatch, the flood comes north to south; south of Mitlenatch, it is the opposite.

It's a very arid island but hosts zillions of seabirds and massive garter snakes. Also, we saw a humpback whale named Smoke!

Back at Sonora, we explored a tiny tidal island! It offered epic views of the tidal rapids and extreme tidal amplitude. Here's the isthmus that connects the island to the mainland during a super low tide.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b2bb369-2506-4422-8ee9-f5a6840d5c65" width="600"/><br>Fig 8. Tidal isthmus exposed during low tide at "Alcatraz" Island.</p><br>

And then here's that isthmus fully inundated when the tide has risen!

The tidal currents around Sonora were insane (~13 knots when we were there). Here's a video from the little tidal island during a flood tide.

There were tons of eddies and boils during this super energetic flood.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/518c78c4-97ff-4ae3-8792-b4930d9d6ad1" width="600"/><br>Fig 11. Flood tide surface in the lee of "Alcatraz" Island.</p><br>

We also witnessed one of the coolest things I've ever seen - all of this high energy flow slowing and reversing after the most peaceful slack. I've never seen this actually happen before, especially in such a narrow, energetic channel. Here's the end of flood at 7:02pm.

Then the full slack at 7:25pm.

Then finally the very beginning of ebb tide at 7:29pm.

I came away with such an appreciation for the region we study, in particular the pristine, nearly untouched environment near the Johnstone Strait where there are more seals, eagles, and whales than people. I'm excited to get back to work on understanding and making our home waters of the Salish Sea as perfect as they can be.
