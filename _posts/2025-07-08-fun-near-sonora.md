# Off-Piste - Fun Observations Near Sonora Island

### Quick Stop on Salt Spring Island

This is work-related since you can see ocean in the background! Specifically - Stuart Channel (between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island) is shown.


### Big Tides Around Sonora Island

We took a quick jaunt to the towering peaks and narrow channels of the Discovery Islands, the southernmost islands before the narrows beginning with the Johnstone Strait turn into the Strait of Georgia. It's also right next door to Desolation Sound.

Finally we settled in at Sonora Island!

Lucky for us scientists and all the creatures, it was the New Moon - which means we had huge tides! We took a tour to Bute Inlet, crossing the Arran Rapids during ebb tide. I didn't take any pictures since I didn't want to lose it to a whirlpool and the incessant rain made it a bit slippery out! We were looking for bears taking advantage of the super low tides in Bute Inlet; while we didn't see any, we saw about a billion (give or take) bald eagles that evidently wait at the Arran Rapids for sudden upwelling induced by tidal currents to cause fish swim bladders to rupture and provide buffet-style eagle dinner. Wouldn't want to be a fish!

Here's a picture of the cool science outfit we got to wear!

We then went searching for whales after exploring the calm water in the inlets. We made it to Mitlenatch Island, which comes from First Nation Sliammon language for calm waters all around. I haven't verified this in too much depth, but our guide said that this stems from the fact that this is where the tidal current direction switches. North of Mitlenatch, the flood comes north to south; south of Mitlenatch, it is the opposite.

It's a very arid island but hosts zillions of seabirds and massive garter snakes. Also, we saw a humpback whale named Smoke!
