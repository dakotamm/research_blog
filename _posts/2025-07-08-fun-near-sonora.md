This is work-related since you can see ocean in the background! Specifically - Stuart Channel (between Salt Spring Island and Vancouver Island) is shown.



### Big Tides Around Sonora Island

We took a quick jaunt to the towering peaks and narrow channels of the Discovery Islands, the southernmost islands before the narrows beginning with the Johnstone Strait turn into the Strait of Georgia.

Even though this is quite rough, I'm excited for some cool features! The most prominent is that DO lows seem to originate from inside Penn Cove, as observed. Also the "eastward" movement of low DO seems to follow after a significant build-up of low DO water at the entrance. This leads nicely to my next section.
