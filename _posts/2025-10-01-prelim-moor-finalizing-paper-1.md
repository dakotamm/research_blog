# Preliminary Whidbey Model Mooring Exstractions and Finalizing Paper 1 Scope

---

## Mooring Extractions at Penn Cove

I took a brief look at how my test year 2017 nested Whidbey Basin model performs at possible mooring field sites (!) compared to the hindcast model (cas7_t0_x4b). I eyeballed based on planning sketches, but I've replicated five mooring sites as shown below:

The following are daily values taken from the bottom sigma layer of each model:

The intent of this was to start taking a look at model output myself and learn how to use the extraction tools. A few initial thoughts:
* My model (black) surface elevation values are shifted lower by a consistent value. I will look into changing this to be more consistent with the LO hindcast model.
* My model tends to predict more oxygen than the hindcast model.
* It looks like some "freshwater" influx events in the spring are more pronounced in my extractions.

Not a lot of action here yet, but I look forward to evaluating this model with observational data throughout Whidbey Basin.

## Finalizing Paper 1 Scope

As I get to the fine details of revising my Paper 1 for resubmission in the next week or so, I'd like to discuss some shifting conclusions as I've added all three seasons and both surface and bottom trends to discuss. In particular, I want to interrogate the conclusion that "30-100% of DO loss is accounted for by warming" in more depth here. 

This plot shows the portion of the DO trend explained by solubility change (both temperature and salinity based, but 90-99% temperature) for both surface and bottom and all three seasons and all five sites, as indicated:

NOTE: Almost all solubility change is negative in sign. The only exception is at **SP at the surface during winter** where I suspect the large freshening trend actually dominates the solubility-change, since there is minimal temperature change here as well.

This plot takes a minute to dissect, but ultimately 20-100+% of the BOTTOM DO loss is explainable by solubility change...
