## Ocean Visions Reflection

For posterity, I want to record some reflections on AGU Ocean Visions, although we've already discussed most of this:
* General vibe was a little somber given recent administration changes in the US, but other nations seem committed to solving the climate crisis. However, there was not really a question of "should we" intervene in climate; rather, people seemed aligned that the tipping point for "reduction-only" solutions had been surpassed.
* There was significantly more focus on just carbon removal technologies vs. other climate interventions as opposed to the 2023 conference.
* Iron/phytoplankton fertilization seems back on the focus table, at least as something to be re-assessed for feasibility. Aurora and I attended a focused group for monitoring/recording/verification (MRV) to scope feasibility. Overall, the group consensus was that there is a lack of process studies for the carbon pump in potential sites for this technology. However, the group seemed to agree that no new technology needed to be developed, just much more deployment and modeling resource allocation.
* Some start ups (especially Running Tide, a kelp sequestration company) had gone out of business in 2023. This seems to be related to the lack of "commercialization" pathways for this technology, given that the voluntary market for carbon removal is not that hot. There was lots of discussion about the scale of the market for commercialization (how much carbon would be removed by certain technologies) and if that would actually make a significant dent in climate change.
* Indigenous/First Nations stakeholders were more present at this meeting. They advocated for a place at the table as opposed to just being "clued in" to emerging technology and science. They also advocated for community outreach as the first step before any implementation or testing. However, certain speakers echoed the notion that "time is of the essence" and perhaps imperfect communication to communities may be necessary for expedience.
* The Global South was represented, but unfortunately not featured. This begs interesting questions of the best ways to engage lower-income countries/scientific bodies/communities.
* The group was seemingly well split between scientists, start-up folks, and policy/community folks and was quite diverse.
* I think I felt far more confident asking questions, and subsequently found that this field really doesn't have any significant experts. There's as much marketing-speak as anything else, which I think requires strong scientific discernment.
* Overall - excellent conference. Thanks for sending me!

## Paper 1 Reflection

It's out! A bit of a rush at the end to get all the formatting in line and publish my dataframe. I'm very grateful for all the support and proud to have it closer to published. Some more items:
* Send for peer review to Jan, Taylor, Mike...anyone else?
* Should I reach out to anyone to let them know I am using their data? It's a bit late but as a courtesy?
* I need to clean up all of the obs data I was working with and my processing code for integration with our existing LO obs data!

## KC Whidbey Basin Observational Data Exploration

Now onto Penn Cove!!! The first step has been looking at what observational data we have from KC and starting to compare that to existing model data. Get ready for lots of plots! The first one is a map of all the sampling locations that KC has sampled in Whidbey Basin since 2022.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/508a648a-b11e-4bc2-824b-d1854429d1d6" width="600"/><br>Fig 1. King County's Whidbey Basin sites sampled from 2022-2024; maximum LO depth indicated; LO grid shown.</p><br>

Next I've ploted each site's cast time series to verify temporal and spatial resolution consistency. Most sites are well resolved and I can define a bottom depth bin as the bottom 20% of the LO depth and lower.

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41024bce-deb8-4e83-ab57-0205ec84f776" width="800"/><br>Fig 2. King County's Whidbey Basin sites sampling depths from 2022-2024; maximum LO depth indicated + 80\% bottom bin definition.</p><br>

Now I've plotted time series of each site's bottom CT, SA, and DO. I've also compared them to model data. I know this is old, but I'm using the cas6_v0_live and cas6_v1_live data for continuity (mainly since I had it readily available).

I'm a bit light on written interpretation, but I'd love to tease this out in the meeting tomorrow! Overall, this has been a helpful preliminary look at what we have to work with.

Next Steps:
* Set meetings to get more acclimated with running LO, how nested models get set up, and the state of affairs with LO versions/procedures!
* Further data analysis!
