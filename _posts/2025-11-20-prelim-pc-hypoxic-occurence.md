# Preliminary Modeled Penn Cove Hypoxic Occurence

**NOTE:** I have not done further evaluation on the model at this point.

From last week there was a lot of cool chat about using the model to inform field planning. As I'm splitting my time between paper finishing and Penn Cove, I have just a quick plot to show. Here's the hypoxic occurence anywhere in the water column in days using daily snapshots for Penn Cove from my 2017 model:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de9f3643-7025-4e90-97a7-dea6d4f06441" width="800"/><br>Fig 1. Penn Cove modeled hypoxic occurence in days.</p><br>

This allows us to see that hypoxic occurence is concentrated in the southern half of Penn Cove, which is inline with the hypothesized longer residence time on the south side given the flow asymmetry. But it also shows that hypoxia does occur througout the majority of Penn Cove.

Ultimately, I spent time developing ways to visualize these model outputs easily and as a means to assist field planning. Plots that I will make shortly include:
* Hypoxic/low-DO layer thickness
* Depth of hypoxic/low-DO occurrence
* How all of this varies on tidal timescales (using hourly outputs to visualize velocity and advection of low-DO water masses)
* Etc.
