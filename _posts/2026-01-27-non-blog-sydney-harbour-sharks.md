# Off-Piste - Sydney Harbour Rain and Sharks!

Sydney was awesome! However, I didn't get the typical January summer weather... Instead, New South Wales was hit by an extreme storm, bringing big winds and heavy rain. This, of course, provided ample opportunity for some observational coastal and estuary science!

I saw the biggest waves I've seen in real life on Sydney's Northern Beaches. Apparently they got up to 5m at some of these beaches! I didn't measure this myself :).

There was also significant coastal flooding, causing some scary [evacuations](https://www.9news.com.au/national/nsw-beaches-hit-with-enormous-waves-as-rough-conditions-intensify/9543f2ca-c0c8-4227-b18a-6dc00d1cc984)!

Sydney sits on a really cool estuary system, most of which is the Sydney Harbour. It's a shallow-ish (~13m deep on average) drowned river valley. Here's a map:

The storm meant closed beaches for dangerous currents and waves, as well as closures for contamination, since lots of the ocean outfalls for wastewater used only primary treatment! But the storm brought another unexpected risk... SHARKS!!!

We know freshwater is critical to determine estuary hydrodynamics, like the exchange flow. This in turn impacts residence time and oxygen. But - tons of freshwater also brings bull sharks, who love brackish water for rearing their shark pups. Also, lots of nutrients from outfalls and runoff brings prey for these guys. Further, the water was turbid from high energy waves nearshore and all the runoff, meaning sharks were hard to spot! It was a perfect storm leading to [four bull shark attacks in 48 hours](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0err023g5lo). Trigger warning for discussion of shark-related fatality and injuries!

Despite the tragic shark attacks, it was a really cool reminder of the confluence of estuary physics and the lives of apex predators like sharks and humans.

Shout to Sydney's shark alert systems and public infrastructure supporting beach safety, as well as public awareness campaigns for shark activity. While it was unsettling to hear a shark alarm while in the water, I was happy to minimize my time accidentally swimming with sharks!

Never fear - we got plenty of sunshine and the fun side fo Australia!
